# CH5xx examples

The CH5xx examples currently focus on the BLE chips 57x, 58x and 59x, but it is definitely possible to add support for other RISC-V models in the ch5xx range.\

The following table details which demo is working on which chip, since some functionality is still being implemented:

|                   | ch570/2 | ch571/3 | ch58x | ch59x |
|-------------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|
| blink             |    √    |    √    |   √   |   √   |
| debugprintfdemo   |    √    |    √    |   √   |   √   |
| lowpower          |    ×    |    ×    |   ×   |   √   |
| RTC_irq           |    ×    |    ×    |   ×   |   √   |
| systick_irq       |    √    |    ×    |   √   |   √   |
| uartdemo          |    √    |    √    |   √   |   √   |

The Makefiles default to ch570, if you want to compile for another chip only the `TARGET_MCU` and `TARGET_MCU_PACKAGE` need to be changed.
